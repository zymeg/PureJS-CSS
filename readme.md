# Simple&Pure JS&CSS

## What is this?

There are 3 simple JS projects I've made in school. I think that it is great to show how i write code and the way I'm solving problems

_**Note:** Sometimes the teachers required to use specified proggraming techniques or something like that as a part of task_

### [Color picker](https://szymonjaskula.pl/projects/js_css/colorPicker)

Just a simple color picker with RGB, Hex and Percent values

### [Lotto](https://szymonjaskula.pl/projects/js_css/lotto)

Simple lottery game. Put numbers (1-49) and check if you win. If your numbers will match then you win:
+ 3 - 24$
+ 4 - 164$
+ 5 - 5404$
+ 6 - Main Prize

There is probability that someone else will win, and then the cumulation breaks and is set to 2 000 000$

### [One-armed bandit](https://szymonjaskula.pl/projects/js_css/one-armedBandtit)

Enter the rate and check if you win. You win if: 
+ All colours will match
+ All colours will be different

There are 8 possible colours to roll so it is pretty easy. 

If you win your rate will be multiply by 3, but if you lose you'll just lose all money you bet.
